## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#read in the data
milkcow <- read.csv("milkcow_facts.csv")
library(ggplot2)


```

```{r}
head(milkcow)

```

```{r}
milkcow |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=avg_milk_cow_number))+
  geom_line()

```

```{r}
milkcow |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=avg_price_milk))+
  geom_line()
```
